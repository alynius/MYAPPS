# Arabic keyboard Studio

A lightweight single-page web app that provides an Arabic virtual keyboard with tashkeel support and quick actions for copying or searching your text.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple static server (for example `python -m http.server 8000`) from the project root.
2. Type Arabic characters using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard remapped by the app.
3. Use the toolbar buttons to copy or clear your text, launch Google or YouTube searches in new tabs, or save a `.txt` file.

## Keyboard controls

- Toggle shift and caps keys on the virtual keyboard to access alternate characters.
- Click **Hide** on the tashkeel palette to collapse the diacritic keys if you need more room.
